# MathLab-projects
MATLAB mini-projects covering plots, GUI, filters, matrix operations, and image processing.
# MATLAB Projects Collection

This repository contains multiple MATLAB script files and mini-projects demonstrating various functions and operations such as signal processing, plotting, GUI development, and matrix manipulations.

## üìÅ Projects

### 1. `BasicPlot.m`
- Simple 2D plots using `plot()`
- Suitable for visualizing functions

### 2. `FourierDemo.m`
- Demonstrates Fourier transforms
- Uses `fft()` to analyze frequency content

### 3. `SignalFilter.m`
- Applies a filter (low/high pass)
- Could include signal smoothing or denoising

### 4. `SimpleGUI.m`
- Basic GUI using `uicontrol`, sliders, buttons
- Possibly interactive plotting

### 5. `MatrixOps.m`
- Matrix addition, multiplication, inversion
- Useful for linear algebra demos

### 6. `ImageProcessing.m`
- Image read, grayscale conversion, or filtering
- Might use `imread`, `imshow`, `rgb2gray`

### 7. `MathFunctions.m`
- Custom math logic, user-defined functions
- Could involve loops or conditionals

### 8. `AppController.m`
- May serve as main runner or master script
- Calls functions from other scripts

## üì¶ How to Run

1. Open MATLAB.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Open any `.m` file and press **Run**.

## üõ† Requirements

- MATLAB R2020a or newer recommended
- Image Processing Toolbox (for `ImageProcessing.m`)
- Signal Processing Toolbox (for `FourierDemo.m` or `SignalFilter.m`)
